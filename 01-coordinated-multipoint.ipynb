    "## A Hard (and Expensive) Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "A paper [[1]](#1) presented in [SIGCOMM](https://www.sigcomm.org/) 2019 states, \"For optimal performance, \n",
    "an amount of computation that increases at an exponential rate both with the number of users and with the \n",
    "data rate of each user is often required. The base station’s computational capacity is thus becoming one \n",
    "of the key limiting factors on wireless capacity.\" \n",
    "\n",
    "The world's ubiquitous cellphones require huge numbers of base stations to provide the cellular network; for \n",
    "example, in mid 2022, China's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology reported having deployed almost \n",
    "[2 million base stations](https://techblog.comsoc.org/2022/08/19/china-miit-claim-475m-5g-mobile-users-1-97m-5g-base-stations-at-end-of-july-2022/) \n",
    "for its 5G network alone. Operational costs are crucial to network providers and powering base stations \n",
    "[is challenging](https://techblog.comsoc.org/2020/08/07/5g-base-station-deployments-open-ran-competition-huge-5g-bs-power-problem/).  \n",
    "\n",
    "The number of base stations required to serve a large city depends on the bandwidth such stations are \n",
    "capable of serving. Unfortunately, increases in cellphone numbers and noise quickly harden [[2]](#2) the \n",
    "problem of decoding transmissions. The graphic below shows the dependency of transmission errors on \n",
    "[SNRb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal-to-noise_ratio) (signal-to-noise ratio) and the ratio of \n",
    "cellphones to base stations ($\\frac{Tx}{Rx}$). \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"_static/problem_hardness_3d.png\" width=\"500\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Two drivers of profitability for network providers are reducing power consumption and capturing \n",
    "any differences in processing capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is Coordinated Multipoint?\n",
    "\n",
    "Very quickly after the deployment of the first generation of cellular networks it became clear that \n",
    "the naive model of pairing cellphones to a single nearby base station is inadequate. Many technologies \n",
    "have been developed to boost performance. \n",
    "[Cooperative MIMO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooperative_MIMO) (multiple-input multiple-output) \n",
    "effectively exploits the spatial domain of mobile fading channels to significantly improve performance. \n",
    "In one of its variations, Coordinated multipoint (CoMP), neighboring base stations share data and \n",
    "channel state information to enable them to coordinate downlink transmissions and jointly process \n",
    "received signals.  \n",
